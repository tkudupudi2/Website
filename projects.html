					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Made a social networking platform similar to Facebook using Java. I used a graph to design and implement an application that maintains the data for a simple social network. My application allowed a user to join the network, leave the network, create a profile, modify the profile, search for other profiles, and add friends. Tracked the friend relationships among members of the network. Added a feature to enable people to see a list of their friendsâ€™ friends. Made the graphical user interface using JavaFX.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>The key aspects of the projects were to design and fabricate the turbine rotor blades, design and fabricate the support tower, determine the power output of our wind turbine, and measure the stiffness of our support tower. The goals that we attempted to achieve in this lab were to design a rotor blade that produces the most lift, least drag, and most stable. Along with that we attempted to design a support tower that is light, produce a high power output, and produce a high stiffness. We used Solidworks to design the turbine rotor blades.</p>
